What do you do?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'AIIEEEEEE! That\'s a big example of a hydra looking really upset! Don\'t be scared, Sam...remember, superheroes like me solve puzzles, not run from them. Maybe this hydra isn\'t angry. Maybe it\'s hungry! I know! I\'ll find a giant multi-headed sandwich to distract it. After all, "if you can\'t beat \'em, feed \'em!" That\'s the rule in Sam town. Babaga-BOOSH! Now where did I put that oversized loaf of bread...? And gee, I hope my brothers, Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam...oh there\'s too many to name, aren\'t facing hydras too right now. Hi-De-Hydra, and to Hydra dinner I go!'}]
